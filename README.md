##PageSwiper:

This works wonderful inside a current project and are currently refactoring it into a reusable view.

Using a scrollview for side to side pagination is troublesome. With a strong slide it will paginate more than one page at a time. If all the logic and effects were inside the scroll it was alright but if you needed to know what your index was or monitor the swipes things started to get buggy. Things like changing the header dependent on the current index or if your pagination wasn't inside the scroll.
